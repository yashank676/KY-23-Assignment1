# KY'23-Assignment1
## To-do:
* You need to create a carousel/image gallery from scratch.[example](https://dribbble.com/shots/7076255-DailyUI-072-Image-Slider)
* The carousal must have a good animation effect, previous and next buttons, a different text displayed at the bottom of each slide.
* It will be a great addition if the slides of carousal automatically move every 5 seconds.
* Create three sections each of 100vh (100% of the screen height), and this carousel goes to the **second section of your webpage**.
* Feel free to use swiper.js if you want; just make sure your **custom animation** is appealing (a glitch effect will be nicer, but feel free to animate it the way you want).
* You can check out the assignment i made last year [image gallery](https://github.com/rohanb202/KY-frontend-assignment1).
* Take inspiration from sources like dribbble, youtube, or even codepen, but try to create your own work, so you learn something from it.[example](https://dribbble.com/shots/15374169-Layout-010-Kombu-Artwork-Gallery).
* Once started with the work, fill essential details in the [form](https://forms.gle/ibQHHLH74g2JQfXJ7) and submit your work on time, as I'll begin checking your code right after the deadline has reached, so you must not make any commits after submission time.

## How to submit
* Fork this repo.
* Clone it to your local, use any IDE of your choice and, 
* Add/create the files you want with the **optimized size images** (use any online image size optimizer) and begin with your code.
* Commit your changes and push your code by making a pull request.
* Deploy your code on Github pages, netlify, or any other web hosting solution.
* You must complete this task before 10 Aug at 11:59 pm IST.
* Judging criteria will be your custom animation, bug-free, optimized code, with no commits made after the deadline has reached. The work's uniqueness will also be appreciated; feel free to add a custom scrollbar, custom cursor, preloader, etc, to stand out from others.
